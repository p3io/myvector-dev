Currently around 20 of patients are not satisfied after TKA. This project will look to find out if the research team can identify patients who will not recover well at an earlier stage so that these patients can be helped sooner. The study will try to determine if doing intense physiotherapy with patients who are not doing well at the first review 6 weeks after their operation can improve how well they have recovered at one year.The study is a randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of intensive physiotherapy compared to current standard of care therapy targeted to patients performing poorly at 6 weeks following total knee replacement. All patients will be made aware of the study preoperatively at the recruiting centres. Prior to surgery they will complete the routine preoperative outcome assessment questionnaires Oxford Knee Score and EQ5D as part of the national PROMS program and then undergo the local standard total knee replacement and immediate postoperative care pathway. All patients will be routinely reviewed 6 weeks postoperatively by the usual clinical teams. At this review the Oxford Knee Score will again be assessed. Those patients who report a score of 26 or less on the 048 OKS scoring system which is defined as poor by the Kalairajah classification Kalairajah 2005 will be approached to consent. If consent is given and the patient is eligible to enter the trial randomisation into one of the following groups will occur to standard care encompassing a one off physiotherapy review 6 weeks of home exercise prescription and final review or to an interventional arm where 18 sessions of structured physiotherapy will be administered over a 6 week period where 6 of these sessions will be contact sessions performed under the supervision of the physiotherapist. All trial participants will be reviewed immediately post intervention i.e. at 14 weeks post operation and then by postal questionnaire at 26 and 52 weeks postoperation ',)

The hypothesis is patients that receive effective presurgery prehabilitation will demonstrate improved recovery as measured by the 6minute walk 6MW test at one month post surgery.People with knee arthritis have lower levels of physical activity and are more susceptible to suffer from additional medical conditions of heart disease respiratory conditions diabetes and stroke. For patients with end stage knee osteoarthritis total knee arthroplasty TKA has been widely accepted as beneficial for increased patient satisfaction and improved function. To provide high quality of care and optimize TKA outcomes healthcare providers need to make decisions about resource allocation. The theory of Prehabilitation proposes to increase strength balance and endurance prior to surgery with the benefit of less decline and improved rate of recovery following surgery. Preoperative quadriceps strength and walking ability have been shown to be predictive of function one year post operation. However systematic reviews of Prehabilitation have been inconclusive and this warrants additional investigation. Prior studies of Prehabilitation have been inadequately designed or have low levels of therapeutic validity. A prior study completed in Spain provided presurgical exercise three times weekly for eight weeks and provides an example of high therapeutic validity with the corresponding significant results postoperation. The objective of this study is to translate knowledge of the presurgical exercise program completed in Spain into the local context of a hospital system in Virginia. Due to local area considerations of equipment and time modifications of the Spanish presurgical exercise program are to be tested. These adaptations will allow for implementation within American College of Sports Medicine strength training guidelines using individualized exercise progressions and completion of three clinic based sessions per week. Subjects that provide informed consent and complete initial screening will be scheduled for two presurgical and two postsurgical assessment sessions. On the first assessment session subjects will be classified into three levels adapted from prior research and input from clinicians and administration to determine the need for presurgical preparation. Those subjects in the two most severe levels will be asked to participate in a Prehabilitation exercise program for three times a week for eight weeks and if consent is provided will be randomized into the control Joint Education Home Exercise Class only or the intervention exercise program using a gender stratified randomized sequence generated prior to subject recruitment. The researcher will notify sequential subjects of their group allocation based on the predetermined randomized sequence at the end of the first testing session. The goal of the prehabilitative exercise is to provide an individualized exercise program to be completed 3xweek for 8 weeks. The exercise sessions will be completed in the rehabilitation office at the Institute of Orthopedics and Neurology ION by physical therapy students with oversight from licensed PT at no cost for each subject. Ongoing evaluation of each exercise session will use the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion RPE supplemented with Heart Rate HR and Blood Pressure as needed to target the moderate intensity training level 4060 HR Max or above as appropriate to each individual. Weekly evaluation of each individuals exercise program will be completed and progressed as able. Outline of Exercise program includes Warmup Low intensity 40 HR Max 5 minutes of walking or bike Flexibility knee flexionext and hamstring stretching Strengthening Balance and Functional activities Moderate intensity 4060 HR Max o Closed kinetic chain exercises for balance and strengthening 23 sets of 820 reps Calf raises unilateralbilateral Quarter squats progressed to full squats as tolerated Resisted Step Progression goal of isolated quads Lunge with and without upper extremity support Stepups anteriorly Stepdowns laterally Balance program goal of Single Leg Stance SLS and BOSU wobble board unilateral for 30 seconds Weight shifts LR and AP Standing marching Single leg stance BOSU B maintain stability BOSU B with RL rocking AP rocking BOSU B with quarter squats BOSU Unilateral o Progressive Resistance exercises with elastic resistance bands 3 sets of 812 RM with 2 min rest period between sets Leg Press bilateral to unilateral alternate use of total gym or resisted squats Seated Knee Extensions Standing Knee Curls Elastic band resisted hip ABD LR start with sidelying resisted clam shells Manual therapy according to individual patient needs using a pragmatic approach to assist with weight bearing activity for example squats Cooldown 5 minutes Low intensity 40 HR Max of walking or bike Statistical comparisons will be conducted using a repeated measures linear mixed model with group time and group by time as independent variables. Analyses will be adjusted for age gender BMI and baseline of the outcome measure. The primary outcome will be the 6MW presurgerypreexercise compared to one month postsurgery. Secondary outcomes include relevant clinical metrics e.g. acute length of stay impairment measures e.g. strength physical performance tests e.g. gait speed and the sixminute walk test physical activity measured by Actigraph accelerometer and patient reported outcomes e.g. PROMIS for global health. All measures will be collected at four time points T1 approximately twelve weeks presurgery before starting the exercise program T2 approximately two weeks presurgery after completion of the exercise program T3 one month after joint replacement surgery and T4 three months after joint replacement surgery. Potential benefits at the individual level include improved recovery of function post TKA and improved overall physical activity. Potential benefits at the companysocietal level are improved surgical rehabilitation outcomes including shorter hospital stay quicker return to function and decreased pain.

Vector Search Result from our internal database :  (' Impact of Prehabilitation in Total Knee ReplacementImpact of Prehabilitation in Total Knee Arthroplasty Outcomes and Healthcare Service UtilizationA study comparing the benefits of prehabilitation exercise to standard care prior to total knee arthroplasyRecovery post Total Knee Replacement Surgery TKA has been a subject of interest. In a study of 379 patients who had hip or knee replacement surgery it was reported that at 6 months postsurgery patients with better baseline function had superior functional ability and less pain than patients with lower function at baseline. Another study of 276 patients undergoing TKA reported that preoperative joint function was a predictor of joint function and overall function at 6 months postsurgery. These findings suggest that prehabilitation to increase functional ability prior to TKA may have a positive effect in recovering postsurgery. In a randomized control trial of patients receiving TKA the group receiving an Exercise Program prehabilitation made significant improvements in performance from baseline to before surgery and at 1 and 3 months post surgery. For the group that did not receive the Exercise Program presurgery significant improvement did not occur until 3 months post surgery. The overall objective of the proposed singleblinded randomized controlled trial is to demonstrate that a well designed prehabilitation program for patients receiving TKA surgery will significantly improve outcomes related to pain and function and may reduce utilization of health care services post surgery. In this randomized control trial we hypothesize that the group of participants who receive a prehabilitation Exercise Program will recover quicker than patients who do not receive the Exercise Program based on several measures of performance including pain quadriceps strength range of motion and quality of life ',)

It is the principal indication for total knee arthroplasty TKA. Patients functional state and pain level are generally improved after TKA and the physical and functional status preTKA are predictive of recovery after surgery. Decreasing length of stay at surgery departments and promoting return at home after TKA are recommended. The recommendations of the Health Authority in France HAS and the new law of finance for French clinics contribute to shorter hospital stays and to restrain the conditions of admission to Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation department after TKA.Exercise and education programs conducted before TKA could help better prepare patients for surgery improve functional outcome and accelerate functional recovery after surgery thus reducing the length of stay in orthopedic departments and facilitate return to home directly or after a stay in PMR departments. The type of program necessary to achieve those goals remains to be defined.A systematic review of the literature associated with an analysis of practices about the relevance of rehabilitation programs before TKA concluded that the implementation of such programs before TKA was likely to reduce the length of stay in surgery departments and improve the rate of direct return to home after surgery but that high quality trials were lacking. It also suggested that association of exercise programs with educational ones could be more effective than exercise or education alone particularly for fragile patients with impaired functional capacity comorbidities andor social problems ',)

The results after TKA is in general very good the investigators have however discovered that patients following fasttrack TKA still have a deficit 12 months postoperatively of 510 in healthrelated qualityoflife and 1520 in activity and participation when compared to age and gender matched population. A postoperative rehabilitation intervention has the potential to reduce or remove this observed deficit. The current evidence of postoperative rehabilitation after TKA is however scares and conflicting and no studies have shown a lasting effect beyond 3 months postoperatively.

Long standing arthritic joint surfaces more often lead to pain and swelling and other physical factors that may contribute to knee joint instability. This instability causes a feeling of unsteadiness whilst walking and may also contribute to falls. In view of the latter it is important for this issue of unsteadiness to be addressed. TKR helps to remove the cause of pain and swelling but exercises are crucial to counteract the joint instability and any feeling of unsteadiness before and after surgery. However research hasnt yet identified the optimum approach for delivering exercises that will help in patients rehabilitation. Current studies have tried to incorporate rehabilitation programmes to improve this issue but required a delivery of 68 weeks of exercises which has resulted in a logistical burden in view of the long duration. We have scientifically developed a new programme of exercise for the muscles of the knee that can be delivered during a single week prior to surgery. The presurgery exerciseprogramme PSEC potentially offers similar effectiveness for improving the feeling of unsteadiness and muscle fitness as programmes that last much longer. Therefore the purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of this new short approach to exercising in patients who are waiting for a TKR surgery.Total knee arthroplasty TKA is the treatment of choice for patients suffering from severe pain and functional limitation caused by osteoarthritis OA of the knee joints surfaces Magee et al. 2009. Within the UK over 60 000 TKA surgeries are registered yearly NJR 2015 making TKA one of the most common surgeries of the joint. Rehabilitation following surgery is essential for recovery and with TKA this is crucial in regaining movement function and control. Current rehabilitation mainly focuses on postsurgery rehabilitation to increase range of motion ROM and muscle power and to aid in achieving a quick return to functional independence for patients. Despite this research has shown that patients undergoing TKA still continue to experience reduced capacities in neuromuscular responses which are required for quick knee joint reactions stability and proprioception up to months following TKA surgery Silva et al. 2003. A deficit in an individuals knee joint proprioception synonymously referred to as a deficit in sensorimotor performance together with impaired strength can lead to reduced functional balance capabilities and movement control Piva et al. 2010 Ratsepsoo et al. 2011 and can also contribute to injury Lephart et al. 1997 and a greater risk of falls Swinkels et al. 2009 Bade et al. 2010 Ratsepsoo et al. 2011. In part the latter may be due to timeconstraints within the healthcare system where a necessary preservation of the primary focus to decrease pain and improve general function in patients following a TKA has sometimes been to the detriment of other aspects of rehabilitation. Presurgery exerciseconditioning Studies have investigated the effects of presurgery exercise also known as prehabilitation exercise interventions on strength and sensorimotor performance deficits in patients undergoing TKA through various modes of exercise. Their aim has been to utilise a period of time presurgery to improve patients rehabilitation status Huber et al. 2015 Topp et al. 2009 Desmueles et al. 2013 Mackay et al. 2012. However the patterns of patients adaptations to the generic exercise stimuli used within these studies has not shown the gains that had been expected by physiological doseresponse and ultimately questioned the efficacy of using prehabilitation for effective gains in longterm outcomes. Nevertheless the concept of achieving early gains to conditioning status that might potentiate patients later rehabilitation processes and status remains attractive to the latter Calatayud et al. 2016 Huber et al. 2015 and the NHS Rooks et al. 2006 Crowe and Henderson 2003. Conditioning for enhanced sensorimotor performance has been consistently endorsed in the sportsmedical and sportsperformance Hubscher et al. 2010 Mandelbaum et al. 2005 and clinical literature Tsao et al. 2007 Granacher et al. 2006 for its causal relationship to reduced injury likelihood and capability to improve function. While the precise dose of stimuli to achieve gains in sensorimotor performance is less clearly defined enhancing motor performance by means of exercise that resist the effects of gravity or externallyapplied loading to a joint system has established underpinnings physiologically by improving motor performance and indirectly effecting sensorimotor responses Vikne et al. 2006 Hakan et al. 2002 Moran et al. 2007. Clinically the challenge has been to formulate a suitably pragmatic programme of conditioning that will accommodate the time and costpressures associated with contemporary care practice while simultaneously offering efficacy when delivered prior to surgery as a prehabilitative intervention. Rehabilitative and prophylactic conditioning programmes used in current studies for enhanced neuromuscular and sensorimotor performance have typically required and been delivered in a duration of 68weeks Calatayud et al. 2016 Huber et al. 2015 Topp et al. 2009 Desmueles et al. 2013 Mackay et al. 2012. This has commanded a substantive logistical burden to elicit expected gains. A novel approach to conditioning Development of the PSEC protocol A novel formulation of conditioning that could condense the pattern of delivery of physiologicallyeffective doserelated stimuli while simultaneously maintaining the vast proportion of potential gains in performance would offer advantages to patients and clinicians for logistical versatility with which a package of conditioning might be delivered. This would be especially important within the relatively short period of time between the patients electing for surgery after clinical consultation and a surgical procedure if prehabilitation were to be incorporated effectively within care pathways. Recent studies have shown that with careful periodization and microcyclical management of the mode of exerciseconditioning patterning of exercise intensity and workrecovery ratios and progression of increasing physiological stimuli for adaptation it is possible to deliver gains in neuromuscular performance within a programme lasting 23weeks which match 70 of the effects expected during longer programmes Peer and Gleeson in press Peer et al. under review. Additional adaptations to this intervention model would be needed to counteract arthrogenic and autogenic sources of inhibition associated with longterm disease conditions such as OA Rice et al. 2010 limiting neuromuscular performance and conditioning gains by the intrusion of nociceptive stimuli such as an increase in intraarticular joint pressure PalmieriSmith et al. 2007. The costneutrality of the embedding prehabilitative conditioning for improved motor performance might be feasible if a portion of the endphase rehabilitation following a surgical procedure which has been shown recently to offer limited gains in performance within the formal care pathway Bailey et al. 2014 could be sacrificed in favour of an equivalent time period of conditioning prior to surgery. Therefore the purpose of the PSEC study is to undertake a randomized controlled feasibility trial in order to investigate the effects of this new formulation of exerciseconditioning for motor performance on objectivelymeasured and patientperceived sensorimotor functional and psychophysiological performance capacities in patients waiting for a TKA ',)
