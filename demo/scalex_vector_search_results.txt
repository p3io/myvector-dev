Patients will be randomized to these two cohorts at enrollment into the study and followed prospectively. Patients randomized to the formal rehabilitation cohort will receive a prescription for therapy for twelve weeks. Patients randomized to the independent exercise cohort will receive online access to a twelveweek protocol of exercises to perform at home to strengthen and improve function of the replaced joint. At enrollment a baseline evaluation will be conducted to capture demographics height weight primary diagnosis medical comorbidities and social supports as well as completion of the selected outcome measure American Knee Society AKS Score Knee and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score KOOS. Secondary outcomes will include the measurement of health status with use of the Short Form12v2 SF12v2 and activity level with the University of California Los Angeles UCLA Activity Score. At the twelveweek sixmonth and twelvemonth followup visits the study subjects will complete the KOOS SF12v2 and UCLA Activity Score questionnaires. Statistical analysis will be performed to compare the outcomes between the two cohorts. Hypothesis There will be no difference in outcomes between formal rehabilitation and independent exercises at twelve months after primary total knee replacement surgery using the American Knee Society AKS Knee Score.We will randomize patients who are scheduled to have primary total knee arthroplasty to receive either a prescription for formal physical therapy PT or instructions for independent exercises. Inclusion criteria will be scheduled for primary total knee arthroplasty an age of eighteen years or older speak English and have a computer with access to the Internet. Exclusion criteria will be any knee arthroplasty other than total knee patients not planning to return for follow up care patients relying on others for basic functioning do not speak English and do not have a computer with access to the Internet. Enrollment will occur at the initial clinic visit in the surgeons office. Informed consent will be received from patients who will participate in the study at the initial clinic visit and these patients will be randomized equally to either the PTOT or independent exercise cohort using the REDCap website randomization feature. REDCap is a secure webbased application for building and managing online surveys and databases that will be utilized for this study for data management. Patients that will be randomized to PT cohort will be prescribed formal therapy for twelve weeks with supervised exercises to regain knee strength and range of motion. Therapists will not be involved in the study design and therapists will not be informed that patients are participating in this study. The content frequency and duration of the rehabilitation program will be at the discretion of the treating therapist consistent with usual practice. The patients who will be in the independent exercises cohort will be registered on www.careforpatients.com an online rehabilitation resource that provides computer aided rehabilitative exercises. Patients will follow a prepared 12week protocol of exercises to perform postoperatively to gradually regain their knee strength and range of motion. Postoperative weeks 0 1 the patients will perform three sets of ten repetitions everyday of supine ankle pumps supine heel slides seated quad sets supine glut sets and supine hip abductionadduction. The patient will also perform three sets of patella mobilization for one minute each and three sets of one repetition of supine knee extension. Postoperative weeks 1 2 the patients will perform three sets of ten repetitions everyday of supine heel slides prone knee flexion supine knee extension supine SLR flexion sidelying SLR abduction prone SLR extension sidelying SLR adduction. The patient will also perform three sets of patella mobilization for one minute each and three sets of one repetition of supine knee extension with weight. Postoperative weeks 2 4 the patients will perform three sets of ten repetitions everyday of standing knee extension standing knee flexion standing SLR flexion standing SLR abduction standing SLR extension standing SLR adduction. The patient will also perform three sets of patella mobilization for one minute each three sets of sitting hamstring stretch for thirty seconds each prone quad stretch for thirty seconds each and three sets of single leg stance for thirty seconds each. Postoperative weeks 4 8 the patients will perform three sets of ten repetitions everyday of bilateral mini squats standing SLR flexion standing SLR abduction standing SLR extension standing SLR adduction. The patient will also perform three sets of sitting hamstring stretch for thirty seconds each and prone quad stretch for thirty seconds each. Postoperative weeks 8 12 the patients will perform three sets of ten repetitions everyday of bilateral wall squats forward stepups and side stepups. The patient will also perform three sets of sitting hamstring stretch for thirty seconds each and prone quad stretch for thirty seconds each. Patients will be advised to perform these exercises as often as possible but at least once a day. All patients will have regularly scheduled followup visits per usual practice at sixweeks postoperatively sixmonths postoperatively and 12months postoperatively where a physical exam will be performed to check the range of motion of the knee gait and lower leg muscle strength.

While pain is predictably reduced function does not typically ever reach that of agematched uninjured subjects. Quadriceps weakness has been implicated in the development and progression of knee OA and is a significant problem after TKA. Advance to return to normal daily activities is not sufficient to restore knee function or quadriceps strength after TKA. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of progressive exercise program restoring knee strength mobility and improving the functional outcome after primary TKA.Many studies have shown that after TKA pain decreased significantly but muscle strength of the operated knee did not recover and may stay under the preoperative level. To find out the effects of progressive exercise program the investigators will perform 6 weeks after TKA a randomized clinical trial of lower extremity strength training using two subgroups of people traditional exercise group and progressive exercise group ',)
Vector Search Result from our internal database :  (' The Effects of Prehabilitative Exercise on Functional Recovery Following Total Knee ArthroplastyThe Effects of Prehabilitative Exercise on Functional Recovery Following Total Knee ArthroplastyThe primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of presurgery exercise known as Prehabilitation on functional outcomes for patients following Total Knee Arthroplasty TKA surgery. The hypothesis is patients that receive effective presurgery prehabilitation will demonstrate improved recovery as measured by the 6minute walk 6MW test at one month post surgery.People with knee arthritis have lower levels of physical activity and are more susceptible to suffer from additional medical conditions of heart disease respiratory conditions diabetes and stroke. For patients with end stage knee osteoarthritis total knee arthroplasty TKA has been widely accepted as beneficial for increased patient satisfaction and improved function. To provide high quality of care and optimize TKA outcomes healthcare providers need to make decisions about resource allocation. The theory of Prehabilitation proposes to increase strength balance and endurance prior to surgery with the benefit of less decline and improved rate of recovery following surgery. Preoperative quadriceps strength and walking ability have been shown to be predictive of function one year post operation. However systematic reviews of Prehabilitation have been inconclusive and this warrants additional investigation. Prior studies of Prehabilitation have been inadequately designed or have low levels of therapeutic validity. A prior study completed in Spain provided presurgical exercise three times weekly for eight weeks and provides an example of high therapeutic validity with the corresponding significant results postoperation. The objective of this study is to translate knowledge of the presurgical exercise program completed in Spain into the local context of a hospital system in Virginia. Due to local area considerations of equipment and time modifications of the Spanish presurgical exercise program are to be tested. These adaptations will allow for implementation within American College of Sports Medicine strength training guidelines using individualized exercise progressions and completion of three clinic based sessions per week. Subjects that provide informed consent and complete initial screening will be scheduled for two presurgical and two postsurgical assessment sessions. On the first assessment session subjects will be classified into three levels adapted from prior research and input from clinicians and administration to determine the need for presurgical preparation. Those subjects in the two most severe levels will be asked to participate in a Prehabilitation exercise program for three times a week for eight weeks and if consent is provided will be randomized into the control Joint Education Home Exercise Class only or the intervention exercise program using a gender stratified randomized sequence generated prior to subject recruitment. The researcher will notify sequential subjects of their group allocation based on the predetermined randomized sequence at the end of the first testing session. The goal of the prehabilitative exercise is to provide an individualized exercise program to be completed 3xweek for 8 weeks. The exercise sessions will be completed in the rehabilitation office at the Institute of Orthopedics and Neurology ION by physical therapy students with oversight from licensed PT at no cost for each subject. Ongoing evaluation of each exercise session will use the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion RPE supplemented with Heart Rate HR and Blood Pressure as needed to target the moderate intensity training level 4060 HR Max or above as appropriate to each individual. Weekly evaluation of each individuals exercise program will be completed and progressed as able. Outline of Exercise program includes Warmup Low intensity 40 HR Max 5 minutes of walking or bike Flexibility knee flexionext and hamstring stretching Strengthening Balance and Functional activities Moderate intensity 4060 HR Max o Closed kinetic chain exercises for balance and strengthening 23 sets of 820 reps Calf raises unilateralbilateral Quarter squats progressed to full squats as tolerated Resisted Step Progression goal of isolated quads Lunge with and without upper extremity support Stepups anteriorly Stepdowns laterally Balance program goal of Single Leg Stance SLS and BOSU wobble board unilateral for 30 seconds Weight shifts LR and AP Standing marching Single leg stance BOSU B maintain stability BOSU B with RL rocking AP rocking BOSU B with quarter squats BOSU Unilateral o Progressive Resistance exercises with elastic resistance bands 3 sets of 812 RM with 2 min rest period between sets Leg Press bilateral to unilateral alternate use of total gym or resisted squats Seated Knee Extensions Standing Knee Curls Elastic band resisted hip ABD LR start with sidelying resisted clam shells Manual therapy according to individual patient needs using a pragmatic approach to assist with weight bearing activity for example squats Cooldown 5 minutes Low intensity 40 HR Max of walking or bike Statistical comparisons will be conducted using a repeated measures linear mixed model with group time and group by time as independent variables. Analyses will be adjusted for age gender BMI and baseline of the outcome measure. The primary outcome will be the 6MW presurgerypreexercise compared to one month postsurgery. Secondary outcomes include relevant clinical metrics e.g. acute length of stay impairment measures e.g. strength physical performance tests e.g. gait speed and the sixminute walk test physical activity measured by Actigraph accelerometer and patient reported outcomes e.g. PROMIS for global health. All measures will be collected at four time points T1 approximately twelve weeks presurgery before starting the exercise program T2 approximately two weeks presurgery after completion of the exercise program T3 one month after joint replacement surgery and T4 three months after joint replacement surgery. Potential benefits at the individual level include improved recovery of function post TKA and improved overall physical activity. Potential benefits at the companysocietal level are improved surgical rehabilitation outcomes including shorter hospital stay quicker return to function and decreased pain. In addition collaboration between the orthopedists physical therapists and administration to implement new methods such as Prehabilitation contribute to meeting the triple aim of healthcare of improved customer service higher quality and cost savings as required by Medicare payment bundling ',)

Vector Search Result from our internal database :  (' Comparison of Treatments Following Total Knee ReplacementA Comparison of Treatment Methods for Patients Following Total Knee Replacement.Although total knee replacement TKR improves pain in numerous patients it does not resolve many of the substantial functional limitations and physical inactivity that existed for a long time prior to the surgery. Exercise is an intervention that could improve these longterm limitations. To promote these improvements exercise should be implemented at later stage post TKR when patients can tolerate doses of exercise sufficiently high to promote substantial changes. To date we just dont have enough good research to tell us which type of exercise works best for which patients and under which circumstances at later stage post TKR. This research study will provide evidence for recommended interventions during the later stage post TKR. The specific research questions are 1 How do group exercise in the community and individual exercise in rehabilitation clinic compare with usual medical care on physical function and activity outcomes 2 Who are the patients most likely to respond to each exercise intervention 3 Are the approaches safeThis is a comparative effectiveness study designed as a 3group singleblind randomized clinical trial. Two hundred forty older adults who underwent TKR at least 2 months prior and are otherwise eligible will be randomized into one of three treatment approaches 1 clinicbased individual outpatient rehabilitative exercise 2 communitybased group exercise classes or 3 usual medical care. Subjects will be treated for 3 months. Data will be collected before intervention after intervention 3 months and 6 months after randomization. Physical function is a primary outcome and will be assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and a battery of performancebased tests germane to patients post TKR that includes ability to walk manage stairs lift from the floor and the chair and oneleg balance. We will also use an accelerometerbased monitor that provides a realtime measure of physical activity during normal daily living and is able to accurately capture most levels of activity. Linear mixed models will be fitted to compare the changes in outcome across groups. Logistic regression will identify patient characteristics that predict functional recovery in the exercise groups.

Study design This a longitudinal followup study of a cohort of participants who have been diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis and who will all be undergoing total knee arthroplasty. After enrolment into the study baseline assessments will be done prior to total knee arthroplasty. After total knee arthroplasty participants will be followedup and the same assessments done at baseline will also be done at 6 weeks and 3 to 6 months postoperatively. Habitual physical activity and sedentary behaviour will be measured using accelerometry Actigraph GTX3 and ActivPal monitors at the specific time points.The ActiGraph will be worn by participants for 24 hoursday for seven days at each of the assessment time points. It will be attached to an elastic nylon strap which the participants can wear as a belt around the waist on the side of rightleft hip depending on which knee is being operated on. Thus the ActiGraph will be worn on the side of left hip if the total knee arthroplasty is on the left knee and vice versa. Participants will be asked to remove the ActiGraph when showering bathing or swimming. After seven days of accelerometer wear the accelerometers will be collected at the next possible visit to the hospital or arrangement will be made for collection from participants at a location most convenient to them. An ActivPAL will be taped to the thigh of the patient with waterproof taping and the patient will be asked to keep the ActivPAL on for the same amount of time as the ActiGraph. The ActivPAL can be covered with waterproof taping therefore there will be no need to remove the ActivPAL when showering bathing or swimming. The ActivPAL will be collected at the same time as the ActiGraph. In addition general health functional ability generic quality of life and sleep and pain questionnaires will be conducted at each time point on each participant. Study Site The study will be conducted at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital in Johannesburg South Africa. It is an accredited central hospital with about 1088 beds serving patients from across Gauteng and neighbouring provinces. The hospital is situated in Parktown and also serves as the main teaching hospital for the University of the Witwatersrand Faculty of Health Sciences. Study participants will be recruited from the Division of Orthopaedics in the hospital. This hospital is chosen because 1 it is a tertiary hospital that runs several specialist clinics including the Orthopaedic Division where total knee arthroplasty is performed and 2 there is a collaboration between the Academic staff of the Faculty of Health Sciences of University of the Witwatersrand and the hospital Staff for teaching and research which will facilitate accessibility to patients. Sample Size Determination Based on an anticipated 2 decrease in the amount of time spent in sedentary behaviour per day which for an average 16 hour day equates to a 20 minute reduction a sample size calculation shows that a total sample of 107 participants will be required in this study to detect a significant effect of knee arthroplasty on sedentary behaviour with a power of 80.
